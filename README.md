# Django-Batch-Loading-One-to-Many-Data
This project is based on ["Django Features and Libraries" ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-features-libraries?specialization=django)
Taught by: Charles Russell Severance, Clinical Professor

The main idea is using scripts and django models.py file in order to develop a data model from a file of un-normalized data and load data in to that model. It is qite common to build a web site and then need to pre-load it with data from a file or API.
